# Parential-Control-System
The main objective of this parental control is to track all the activities of their children.
Keylogger is used for action of tracking the keys. 
Whenever the user presses the keyboard every key is going to be stored in a text file in a non-understandable format.
The screenshot, system information, clipboard information and audio will be recorded and gets stored in their respective files in an encrypted format
and gets sent to the email automatically without any effort who are monitoring the activities. 
There are keyloggers which were implemented in various ways but the software which we have implemented had the advanced features of
recording all the information including screenshot, audio, system information and clipboard information.
Every file that recorded whether it may be an image or audio it will be gets encrypted and it will not be known to the user. 
This project gives a wide scope for many of the applications like network trouble shooting and spying.
